### How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React Bootstrap

I made this website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Card and Button components are imported from React-Bootstrap. Deployed via Netlify.

### Lessons Learned:
Through this project, I learned about the `scroll-margin-top` property to define scroll snap areas. Making the villager roster also gave me more confidence with making dynamic components.
